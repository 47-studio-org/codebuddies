##What is CodeBuddies?
We're an international community of independent code learners who support each other on Slack, schedule hangouts to learn with each other at http://hangouts.codebuddies.org, and contribute to an anonymous weekly shout-out newsletter at http://codebuddies.org/weekly. Learning with each other helps us learn faster. We’ve also teamed up with The Odin Project member volunteers on a Facebook group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/TOPSTUDYGROUP/. We strive to create a safe space for anyone interested in code to talk about the learning process. The project is free and open-sourced on Github.

##Is CodeBuddies an organization?
No. It's a free-spirited community of enterprising learners and amazing volunteers who enjoy sharing knowledge with each other.

CodeBuddies Hangouts Platform v2.0 will be built using meteor and will feature:

### P1 Issues
- [issue 5] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/5) - ability to see who else is online when you load the frontpage (or hangout-page)
- [issue 6] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/6) - a spot for every person to fill in a “current status” to describe what they’re “currently working on”. This way, you’ll be able to see at a glance what everyone is working on.
- [issue 7] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/7) - create a new (google?) hangout with a click of a button.
- [issue 8] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/8) - ability to start a hangout “NOW” and not have to specify an end time
- [issue 10] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/10) - an explanation of the types of hangouts one can create:
silent hangout / general study motivation hangout where video + mic is muted teaching hangout (hangout creator will be someone who wants to teach)
talk through a chapter of a dense programming book or article
pair program on a set of coding exercises
work on TUTORIAL X at the same time and ask each other questions if they come up (mostly silent, but everyone working on the same material)
Project (Like codequarters)
- [issue 11] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/11) - an embed of the slackin widget to let people sign up on the codebuddiesmeet slack
- [issue 13] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/13) - an explanation of the #100daysofcode challenge and #todayilearned hashtag (currently side projects in development by @abdulhannanali and @linda… if you guys want to help let us know in #codebuddies-meta!)
- [issue 14] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/14) - an explanation of how to use Slack -- e.g. recommend downloading the slack app so one can join other Slack communities as well without having to switch, short explanation of the 88 channels, highlights of some channels such as
- [issue 12] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/12) - An “about” page (or section of the home page?) explaining what the community is about, and some of the top contributors here -- i.e. people who’ve made pull requests, are volunteer moderators on the Slack, have lots of /prowd points, etc.

### P2 Issues
- [issue 15] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/15) - ability to schedule start and end times for future hangouts (existing feature on hangouts.codebuddies.org)

### P3 Issues
