#CodeBuddies Hangouts Platform v2.0 - from scratch

#FAQ

##What is CodeBuddies?
We're a community of independent code learners who help each other on [Slack](http://codebuddiesmeet.slack.com], [schedule hangouts](http://hangouts.codebuddies.org) to learn with each other, contribute to a periodic [anonymous crowdsourced newsletter](http://tinyletter.com/codebuddies) where anyone can share a personal project or leave a shout out, and post on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/groups/TOPSTUDYGROUP/). We come from all over the world; there are members living in the United States, Japan, Sweden, the United Kingdom, Russia, Australia, Canada, India, and more.

Learning with each other helps us learn faster. We strive to create a safe space for anyone interested in code to talk about the learning process. The project is free and open-sourced on Github.

##What are you trying to build here?

##Why are you building this site?
Our community spends a lot of time helping each other on [our public Slack](http://codebuddiesmeet.slack.com) (P.S. You can get an invite [here](http://codebuddiesmeet.herokuapp.com) if you want to join), but it's hard to schedule google hangout study times via Slack, and it's also hard to know who else is online and available for joining a hangout to work on something together. The platform we're building will help solve those issues.

##How do I contribute to this project?

##What are some priority issues you've got so far?

### P1 Issues
- [issue 5] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/5) - ability to see who else is online when you load the frontpage (or hangout-page)
- [issue 6] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/6) - a spot for every person to fill in a “current status” to describe what they’re “currently working on”. This way, you’ll be able to see at a glance what everyone is working on.
- [issue 7] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/7) - create a new (google?) hangout with a click of a button.
- [issue 8] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/8) - ability to start a hangout “NOW” and not have to specify an end time
- [issue 10] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/10) - an explanation of the types of hangouts one can create:
silent hangout / general study motivation hangout where video + mic is muted teaching hangout (hangout creator will be someone who wants to teach)
talk through a chapter of a dense programming book or article
pair program on a set of coding exercises
work on TUTORIAL X at the same time and ask each other questions if they come up (mostly silent, but everyone working on the same material)
Project (Like codequarters)
- [issue 11] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/11) - an embed of the slackin widget to let people sign up on the codebuddiesmeet slack
- [issue 13] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/13) - an explanation of the #100daysofcode challenge and #todayilearned hashtag (currently side projects in development by @abdulhannanali and @linda… if you guys want to help let us know in #codebuddies-meta!)
- [issue 14] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/14) - an explanation of how to use Slack -- e.g. recommend downloading the slack app so one can join other Slack communities as well without having to switch, short explanation of the 88 channels, highlights of some channels such as
- [issue 12] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/12) - An “about” page (or section of the home page?) explaining what the community is about, and some of the top contributors here -- i.e. people who’ve made pull requests, are volunteer moderators on the Slack, have lots of /prowd points, etc.

### P2 Issues
- [issue 15] (https://github.com/codebuddiesdotorg/cb-v2-scratch/issues/15) - ability to schedule start and end times for future hangouts (existing feature on hangouts.codebuddies.org)
